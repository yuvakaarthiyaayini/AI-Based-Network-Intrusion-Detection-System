# AI-Based Network Intrusion Detection System

This project implements a Machine Learning based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
to identify malicious network traffic using a Random Forest classifier.

## Features
- Machine Learning based attack detection
- Live network traffic simulation
- Interactive Streamlit dashboard
- Accuracy and confusion matrix visualization

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Output
The system classifies network traffic as:
- Normal Traffic
- Intrusion Detected
